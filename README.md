# phase1_proj

The motivation behind the project was initially the project guidelines and my enrollment in the flatiron school. In looking to make the coding more practical I thought of how this project can be beneficial beyond the program. My creative work only really lives in one place, social media sites. This was a great opportunity for me to make something I can use as well as have it function as a project. So, I built a site where I can have some of my creative displayed and interacted with. There were no shortage of challenges. Incorporating "like" and "dislike" features was forsure the most head scratching I've done in some time.
